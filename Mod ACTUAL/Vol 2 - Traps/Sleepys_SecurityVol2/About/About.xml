[b]Roadmap:[/b]

[b]On Going Games:[/b]
- Safe to add to an ongoing game
- It will cause issues if removed from an existing save (consider starting a new game to see if you are happy with the content). You can try destroying all the content added but I'd be worried existing addictions might cause problems with world pawns.

[b]Compatibility[/b]
- Combat Extended: Not Compatible (I don't play with this mod sorry, if my mod becomes popular enough, I'll write a patch)

[b]Integrated Compatibility:[/b]
None at the moment.
